Which factors affect asylum decisions for refugees? More specifically, which factors enable acceptance of asylum applications?

# Data {style="font-size: 20px"}

**UNHCR R Package: Refugees**

Datasets used:

1.  Population:

    Contains data on forcibly displaced and stateless persons by year, including refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people (IDPs), and stateless people. It is structured by year, country of asylum, and country of origin with separate columns for each population group.

2.  Asylum Decisions:

    Provides information on decisions taken on asylum claims by year and countries of asylum and origin. It includes data on application recognition, rejection, and administrative closures of asylum claims.

3.  Asylum Applications:

    Consists of data on asylum applications, detailing the procedure type and application type. It helps in understanding the number and nature of asylum applications filed over time.

4.  Demographics

    Offers demographic and sub-national data, where available, including disaggregation by age and sex. This dataset is vital for understanding the demographic profile of displaced population.
    
    
**Standalone Dataset for Coordinates**

The dataset named, *world_country_and_usa_states_latitude_and_longitude_values* was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state?resource=download)

It gives the latitude and longitude values for each country. 


# Methodology {style="font-size: 20px"}

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**
The first step was to understand the data itself before applying any further methods. We looked at different datasets to understand the most important factors counted in the refugee applications.

1. Countries with Highest Refugee Population
2. Refugee Types over Decades
3. Refugees Settled in Different Regions
4. Refugees by Country of Origin
5. Application Types
6. Application Countries
