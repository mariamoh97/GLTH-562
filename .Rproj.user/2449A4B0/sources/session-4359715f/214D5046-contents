# Research Question {style="font-size: 20px"}

Which factors affect asylum decisions for refugees? More specifically, which factors enable acceptance of asylum applications?

# Data {style="font-size: 20px"}

**UNHCR R Package: Refugees**

Datasets used:

1.  Population:

    Contains data on forcibly displaced and stateless persons by year, including refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people (IDPs), and stateless people. It is structured by year, country of asylum, and country of origin with separate columns for each population group.

2.  Asylum Decisions:

    Provides information on decisions taken on asylum claims by year and countries of asylum and origin. It includes data on application recognition, rejection, and administrative closures of asylum claims.

3.  Asylum Applications:

    Consists of data on asylum applications, detailing the procedure type and application type. It helps in understanding the number and nature of asylum applications filed over time.

4.  Demographics

    Offers demographic and sub-national data, where available, including disaggregation by age and sex. This dataset is vital for understanding the demographic profile of displaced population.
    
    
**Standalone Dataset for Coordinates**

The dataset named, *world_country_and_usa_states_latitude_and_longitude_values* was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state?resource=download)

It gives the latitude and longitude values for each country. 


# Methodology {style="font-size: 20px"}

**Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**
The first step was to understand the data itself before applying any further methods. We looked at different datasets to understand the most important factors counted in the refugee applications.

1. Countries with Highest Refugee Population
  We wanted to first look at what the migration trends look like, specifically some countries of interest in the last year of data. 
  
2. Refugee Types over Decades
  The next was to then look at historical data which could show who are the most frequent types of refugees or displaced individuals.

3. Refugees Settled in Different Regions
  Based on UNHCR's regions, we try to explore where refugees have settled the most over the years to understand how important countries of application can be.
  
4. Refugees by Country of Origin
  In the last decade, we wanted to understand where refugees are coming from the most. It gives us a better idea of where applications could be coming the most from. 
  
5. Application Types
  There were 3 main types of applications- joint, UNHCR, and the national government of the country of application. 
  
6. Application Countries
  Finally, we move from regions to specific countries and chart how preferences have changed over the years when applicants apply for asylum. This could give us an idea of which countries could be friendlier or deemed safer for those escaping violence.
  

**Prediction Model**
In order to assess the rate of application acceptance, we created a machine learning based prediction model. The model used was a Random Forest regression model. We used this particular model since our input variables were categorical in nature while our output was a continuous value. Tree based models are more amenable to categorical input without extensive encoding.

Our variable of interest was the acceptance rate of decisions for every origin-application country pair each year. The value was calculated using accepted number of applications and the total decisions given by a particular pair of countries. 

The random forest model gave an RMSE value of 0.283 which shows that the differences between actual and predicted values were small. 

Dependent Variable: Acceptance Rate
Independent Variables: ISO Codes for Countries of Origin and Asylum, Procedure Type, Decision Level, Applicant Type

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

1. Countries with Highest Refugee Population- We see that Syria had the largest proportion of refugees in 2022.

2. Europe had the most number of refugees settled

3. Most internally displaced persons belong to African countries and may not necessarily be looking at asylum applications

4. The given dataset can help in training a robust model which can predict one's chances of asylum acceptance, given their country of origin, where they are applying, who they are submitting the application to, and whether they are applying individually or as a case group. However, a robust model requires more explanatory data and more data cleaning than was done for our base model. At the same time, this model can be used as a foundation to improve upon and build a stronger predictor analysis.
