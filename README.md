# Data

**UNHCR R Package: Refugees**

Datasets used:

1.  Population:

    Contains data on forcibly displaced and stateless persons by year,
    including refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people
    (IDPs), and stateless people. It is structured by year, country of
    asylum, and country of origin with separate columns for each
    population group.

2.  Asylum Decisions:

    Provides information on decisions taken on asylum claims by year and
    countries of asylum and origin. It includes data on application
    recognition, rejection, and administrative closures of asylum
    claims.

3.  Asylum Applications:

    Consists of data on asylum applications, detailing the procedure
    type and application type. It helps in understanding the number and
    nature of asylum applications filed over time.

4.  Demographics

    Offers demographic and sub-national data, where available, including
    disaggregation by age and sex. This dataset is vital for
    understanding the demographic profile of displaced population.

**Standalone Dataset for Coordinates**

The dataset named,
*world_country_and_usa_states_latitude_and_longitude_values* was
downloaded from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state?resource=download)
